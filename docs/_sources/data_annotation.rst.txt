Annotating data for layout detector
===================================

Ground truth PAGE XML files can be created using the page_editor tool. Here are some basic examples of its
usage. The editor uses drawing lines for making new lines/regions as well as selection of existing objects.
A hint image with keyboard controls will be displayed upon running.

Layout ground truth from scratch
--------------------------------

When the editor is run with path to input images only, it will iterate over the image files and create a
corresponding PAGE XML in the specified output path.
::
    python "${PERO_PATH}/layout/page_editor.py" -i /path/to/input/images -o /path/to/output/pages -s

The -s flag tells the editor to skip images for which corresponding PAGE XML already exists in the
output folder. Without it, the editor will go through all the images again, with the previously
done layout annotation as a starting point.

.. note:: Beware of overlapping regions which will result in duplicit lines.
.. note:: Using the editor tool will leave you with a folder of images and a folder of PAGE XMLs. You can use a simple shell script located in /mnt/matylda1/ikodym/pero/data/list_dataset.sh to convert them into a training file.

Layout ground truth from existing PAGE XML
------------------------------------------

The editor can also load pre-existing PAGE XML files, for example imperfect outputs of a layout detector.
If the output folder is not specified, the input PAGE XML files will be overwritten with the edited layout.
::
    python "${PERO_PATH}/layout/page_editor.py" -i /path/to/input/images -p /path/to/input/pages -o /path/to/output/pages -s

Layout ground truth from external data
--------------------------------------

Any valid PAGE XML should be compatible with pero except for the text line shape format. Text lines are usually
specified by a baseline and a bounding polygon. In pero, text lines are specified by a baseline, ascender
height and descender height in form of custom xml tags, from which the bounding polygon is then computed.
If you want to use data from other sources such as Transkribus annotations directly for training, they can
be converted (i. e. the heights are guessed from the polygons) automatically by resaving them using an "empty" run of parse_folder script in pero_ocr package. ::
    python "${PERO_OCR_PATH}/user_scripts/parse_folder.py" -c './config_empty.ini' --input-image-path /path/to/images --input-xml-path /path/to/pages --output-xml-path /path/to/output/pages

where the config_empy.ini looks like this:
::
    [PAGE_PARSER]
    RUN_LAYOUT_PARSER = no
    RUN_LINE_CROPPER = no
    RUN_OCR = no
    RUN_DECODER = no

If you want to edit data from external sources with the editor, they will be converted automatically when loading
them.

If the text line polygons are wrong or missing in the data but the baselines are correct, you can let an existing
layout detector predict the ascender and descender heights and create the polygons. You can specify this in the
[LAYOUT_PARSER] section of the config as
::
    DETECT_LINES = no
    DETECT_REGIONS = no
    ADJUST_HEIGHTS = yes

and then use the resulting PAGE XMLs for further annotation or training. An example of config that will use
the latest model for height adjustment is in
::
    /mnt/matylda1/ikodym/configs/config_heights.ini

External data format is often weird, for example sometimes the text line bounding polygon can be in form of a
text region polygon. Once again, you can convert such data using the pero_ocr package by adding the following
layout parser to config:
::
    [LAYOUT_PARSER_2]
    METHOD = LINE_POSTPROCESSING
    HEIGHTS_FROM_REGIONS = yes
